# Building Accessible Web Applications

Web accessibility ensures that websites and web applications are usable by people with disabilities. It's not just a nice-to-have featureâ€”it's a necessity for creating inclusive digital experiences.

## Why Accessibility Matters

- **Inclusivity**: Ensures everyone can use your application
- **Legal Compliance**: Many countries have laws requiring web accessibility
- **SEO Benefits**: Many accessibility practices improve SEO
- **Better UX for Everyone**: Accessible design often improves usability for all users

## Core Accessibility Principles

### Semantic HTML

Using the right HTML elements for their intended purpose:

```html
<!-- Bad -->
<div class="button" onclick="submit()">Submit</div>

<!-- Good -->
<button type="submit">Submit</button>
```

### Keyboard Navigation

Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible:

```javascript
// Add keyboard support to custom components
element.addEventListener('keydown', (e) => {
  if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
    // Activate the element
    element.click();
  }
});
```

### ARIA Attributes

ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes enhance accessibility:

```html
<button 
  aria-label="Close dialog"
  aria-pressed="false"
  class="icon-button"
>
  <svg>...</svg>
</button>
```

### Focus Management

Proper focus management ensures users can navigate your application:

```javascript
// Set focus to the first field in a form
function openDialog() {
  dialog.showModal();
  const firstInput = dialog.querySelector('input');
  if (firstInput) {
    firstInput.focus();
  }
}
```

## Testing for Accessibility

Always test your applications for accessibility:

1. **Automated Testing**: Tools like Lighthouse, axe, and WAVE
2. **Keyboard Testing**: Navigate using only the keyboard
3. **Screen Reader Testing**: Test with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
4. **Manual Checklist**: Follow WCAG guidelines

## Conclusion

Building accessible applications is an ongoing process that should be integrated into your development workflow. By considering accessibility from the start, you can create experiences that work well for everyone.

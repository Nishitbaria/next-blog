# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that provides a great developer experience with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js solves many common problems in React applications:

- **Server-side rendering**: Better SEO and initial load performance
- **Static site generation**: Blazing fast websites
- **File-based routing**: Intuitive directory structure for pages
- **API routes**: Build API endpoints without a separate backend

## Creating a Next.js App

The easiest way to get started with Next.js is to use `create-next-app`:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

This will set up a new Next.js project with all the defaults and start a development server at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Next.js Features

### Pages and Routing

Next.js uses a file-system based router. Files in the `pages` directory automatically become routes.

### Data Fetching

Next.js provides several ways to fetch data:

- `getStaticProps`: Fetch data at build time
- `getStaticPaths`: Specify dynamic routes to pre-render
- `getServerSideProps`: Fetch data on each request

### API Routes

Next.js allows you to create API endpoints as Node.js serverless functions:

```javascript
// pages/api/hello.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ name: 'John Doe' })
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js is a powerful framework that makes building React applications more efficient and enjoyable. With its built-in features and optimizations, it's a great choice for projects of any size.
